      <p>
        When I came to  Deakin University. i was eager to develop new things from my leranings. So, following 
        ion that path, When I was in my trimester 1 , I prepared a rocket game using C++. This game project 
        was actually the part of the assessment . In that project, I combined various concepts of C++ language 
        including arrays, pointers and structs. It was an exciting experience to create a project like that.
