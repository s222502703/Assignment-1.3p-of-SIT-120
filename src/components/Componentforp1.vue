<h1><u><b>My first Project</b></u></h1>
</div>
<p>
When I was in my secondary school. I prepared a project of digestive system in which I used all the 
recycled material available . The investment cost for that project was zero. The extend upto which I can remember 
now, it was the part of our biology holidays homework and it accounts for 25% of total assessment. 
The foodpipe was prepared from a transparent pipe cut from it's edges. The lungs were made up of 
ballons and the extra pump was also installed to pump the air . The other organs were made up of pulses of
pulses and clay. It was really an exciting thing at that time , to implkemnt the leraning beyond the 
textbooks. I prepred that so well and got A++ grade in that .
